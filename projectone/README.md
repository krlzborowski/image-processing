# Python project for image processing university course

This project can perform chosen transformations on cv2 images:
* fractal generating using affine transformations on a mono image
* Kirsch filtration of a rgb or mono image
* opening of a mono or binary image with line structuring element 
* generating convex hull of a binary image
